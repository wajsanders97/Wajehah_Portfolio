# Project 1: Food Data Central-Nutrient Calculator : Project Overview

* Created a tool for individuals to use to calculate their total amount of nutrients for a meal.  This calculator uses information from the USDA Food Data Central website.
* For this project I searched through all the individual datasets available on Food Data Central 
* Selected the files to use to obtain a list of food and their respective nutrients
* Used python & pandas for cleaning and organizing the data: Showcasing merges, column name changes and reorganization of the columns
* Created a function to group the nutrients by the food item, using names and unique identifiers
* Developed a while loop to accept user input of desired food, each food entered in a list
* List was then applied to function to output all nutrients for each food item.
